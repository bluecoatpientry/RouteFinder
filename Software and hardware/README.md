===========================

Software
========

All of the software that we utilised it distributed freely and easily accessible online with the associated organizations website.


Hardware / Electronics
======================

* 1 Raspberry Pi (Assumed you already own one)

* 2 x Passive Infra-Red Motion Sensors - £0.50 each
* 6 x Push Switches                    - £2.50 each
* 1 x Breakout Board                   - £7.00 each
* Solder                               - N/A, Incredibly cheap in bulk
* Wire                                 - N/A, Incredibly cheap in bulk

The total cost for the basic project we finalized, was £23 plus wire and solder.
For a scaled up project, with four traffic junctions and the utilisation of two Picaxe boards, the total cost comes to around £81 plus wire and solder.


Scaling the product up
======================

* Picaxe Boards                       - £5.00 each

One can utilise Picaxe chips to scale up the project, to utilise multiple junctions to enlarge the model and to create a more realistic route navigation.
