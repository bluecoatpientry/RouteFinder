Introduction
Our aim for this project is to create a traffic sensing app powered by a Raspberry Pi, and also to make a small scale model showing how the system would work in getting a driver from A to B by finding the fastest route. By reducing the time the car is running, the amount of fuel consumed and fumes emitted can both be reduced, which can help the environment.

How it works
The device provides the quickest and fastest route possible to the driver’s destination.  This is done using the Pi, which monitors the traffic nearby at regular intervals, and measures the traffic intensity at the signal points. It will be able to make an accurate estimate of the volume of traffic at a specific point. This will be done by linking it to infrared sensors placed near the signal points. The program then analyses the information and a signal is sent to the device which interprets the signal and then it gives the driver a route which is traffic free and is the shortest. 

Fuel efficiency
The design is also useful for conserving the use of non-renewable fossil fuels that are currently being consumed at an alarming rate. In the US alone over 20 million barrels of oil are consumed per day, and almost half of that amount is used to power vehicles.
The design can decrease the amount of fuel used since the device reduces the time taken to travel from one point to another. By avoiding traffic jams, the time spent by an immobile vehicle- spewing out fumes but not moving-would be reduced. The car engine will be running for less time, thus the combustion of fuels would be for a shorter period. 

Helping society and the environment
With less fuel being used, this could also save on fuel costs for the driver. With the difficulties that many people face at a time when fuel costs are rising dramatically, an effect impacting particularly on people who rely on using a car such as the disabled, this is very important. The reduction in high-traffic areas helps people get around more quickly as well which prevents lateness and increases productivity. As well as this it makes the car more eco-friendly. This is because it reduces the amount of carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide emissions. Thus, ultimately, it reduces the impact of the Greenhouse effect on our planet and helps to maintain a sustainable atmosphere. In addition to this, if the device becomes popular and many people use it, then less oil is used and so the rise in costs will not be as great. Furthermore it means that if the oil is used it can be used on more essential services such as electricity generation.

How is this better than a Satnav?
The key point differentiating this device from a satellite navigation system is that this device is constructed from the Raspberry Pi. On account of the very low cost of this computer, a navigation system built from it is far more accessible to people from less economically developed countries, especially those with great social divides and serious traffic issues such as India and China. This goes a great way to the betterment of society and reduces the impact of heavy traffic on the environment with air and noise pollution.
